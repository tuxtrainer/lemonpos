  * This class is used to display animated messages

  *
  * The concept is based on the idea of providing a less
  * intrusive message when the user needs some little information.
  * The concept is sometimes refered as "No dialogs on dialogs".
  *
  *  It loads a file in SVG format and render it as the skin.
  *  As it is an SVG, it can be scaled to any size.
  *
  *  It is resized according to its parter, and displayed
  *  horizontally centered and vertically positioned below
  *  or above its partner.
  *
  *  This was designed for lemonPOS project.
